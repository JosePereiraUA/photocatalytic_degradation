# Photocatalytic Degradation Companion Tool
A companion tool for analysis of photocatalytic degradations studies in VOC-72M gas analyser or similar equipement.

# Why?
Photocatalytic degradation studies output several files, from which a single value needs to be extracted and plotted. This process takes a couple of hours by hand. Photocatalytic Degradation Companion Tool automates the process to a couple of seconds.

# How?
1. Run the program
2. Select the folder containing all the xxhxx-pic.txt files
3. Adjust the low and high points for data search until a smooth plot is achieved (min: ~10-20, max: ~90-100)
4. (Optional) Adjust the band A and B to compute the catalytic degradation scale (in ugr/L)
5. Export the plotted data to a .xlsx file for further processing in Excel or related software
